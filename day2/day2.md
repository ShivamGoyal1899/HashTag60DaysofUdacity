# Day 2 #60DaysofUdacity

Today I started Lesson 19 and revised the previous concepts till Lesson 18 as well.

### Concepts Studied Today:
- Sampling Distribution
- StDev of Sampling Distributions
- [Simulation Applet](http://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/sampling_dist/index.html)
- Location of Mean
- and yeah solved a lots of practice problem

### Material Referred:
- [Probability Distibution - Wolfram MathWorld](https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/mathematics/probability/probability-distributions/)
- [Standard Error - Statistics How To](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/what-is-the-standard-error-of-a-sample/)
- [Location of Mean - Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/data-distributions-a1/summarizing-center-distributions/a/choosing-the-best-measure-of-center)
- [Measures of Location and Spread - Berkeley](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/Text/location.htm)
- [Z-Scores - MIT](http://web.mit.edu/11.220/spring05/computer_rec/session_5/zscores.htm)

### Progress: 58%
