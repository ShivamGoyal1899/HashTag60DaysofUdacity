### Concepts Studied Today:
- Mean, Median, Mode
- Standard Deviation
- Z-Scores
- Skewed Distribution
- Central Limit Theorem

### Material Referred:
- [Mean, Median, Mode, and Range - Purplemath](https://www.purplemath.com/modules/meanmode.htm)
- [Standard Deviation: Simple Definition](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/probability-and-statistics/standard-deviation/)
- [Z-Score: Definition, Calculation & Interpretation](https://www.simplypsychology.org/z-score.html)
- [Skewed Distribution: Examples & Definition](https://study.com/academy/lesson/skewed-distribution-examples-definition-quiz.html)
